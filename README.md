# Quora-Like Blog Platform

Welcome to the Quora-Like Blog Platform! This project is a simple web application that mimics the basic functionality of a Q&A website like Quora. Users can create, edit, and delete their posts, with each blog being assigned a unique identifier using the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) technology.
No databases are used, the posts from users are stored in a temporary array. This is just for learning purpose.
